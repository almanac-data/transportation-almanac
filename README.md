**An open, versioned index of public transportation data — so the record stays findable when the websites move.**

Transportation Almanac is a **catalog, not a data warehouse**. Each entry is a small, human-reviewed,
machine-validated record pointing to an authoritative public dataset — its canonical source,
how to access it, where it's archived, and whether it is still reachable today. A daily job
re-checks every source and opens an issue when one goes dark.

It covers data from publishers like DOT, FAA, FTA, BTS, and other mobility and infrastructure publishers.

## What's in the catalog

`catalog.json` is the machine-readable index; browse `catalog/` for the human-readable source.
The repo boots with a single placeholder entry so validation and CI can run; **good first issues**
are the fastest way to replace it with real datasets.

## Contributing

You don't need to write code: **[suggest a dataset](../../issues/new/choose)** with a short form
and a curator will turn it into an entry. Prefer a PR? Adding a dataset is one file in `catalog/` —
see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). CI validates every entry against the schema.

Stewards: see [docs/STEWARDING.md](docs/STEWARDING.md).

## The one rule

**Catalog, don't host.** This repo maps data; it does not store data bytes. See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).
